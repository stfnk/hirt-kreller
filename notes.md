## Optimize Workflow
Write a `publish.py` python script to convert blog entries to showcase & properly connect previous & next pages.

Steps that script should take:
1. fetch all blog entries from their corresponding folders
2. insert the entries into a unified blog_entry_prototype.html page
3. for each entry also populate the index.html showcase with subset
